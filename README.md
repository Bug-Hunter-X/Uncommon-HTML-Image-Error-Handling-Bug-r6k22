This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to image error handling. The bug arises from using an invalid image source and an onerror handler that uses the alert() function. This combination can trigger unexpected behavior in some browsers, especially older ones or those with stringent security configurations. The solution provided avoids the alert() function and uses a more robust approach to handle image errors. The bug and its solution are detailed in the respective HTML files.
